                <div class="faq-answer" id="answer1">
                    Homeopathy is a natural form of medicine that uses highly diluted substances to stimulate the body’s self-healing mechanisms. It is based on the principle of "like cures like," meaning a substance that causes symptoms in a healthy person can be used to treat similar symptoms in a sick person.
